## Explaining-ML-EEG-Seizure-Prediction
This is the code used for the paper "Explaining Machine Learning Models for EEG Seizure Prediction". It provides three different full Machine Learning pipelines for seizure prediction (class-balanced Logistic Regression Model, ensemble of 15 Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and an ensemble of 3 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)), including surrogate analysis. It also provides a series of explainability methods adapted to EEG seizure prediction.
